Generate a comprehensive Playwright test suite using @playwright/test in TypeScript to automate the Poll feature in a Live Class session on https://ngage.ngenux.app/dashboard.

Flow:
1. Log in as host (email/ pwd)
2. Start a live session by clicking "Go Live" and allowing mic/camera permissions
3. Invite user "email"
4. Open the Poll section from the sidebar
5. Create a poll with question and multiple options
6. Share the poll with the invited user

Then:
- Log in as invitee ( email /password)
- Access the shared poll and vote

- host will verify the poll answer of invitee

Test Expectations:
- Automatically cover all relevant positive, negative, and edge test cases
- Validate the functionality of poll creation, option display, submission, re-submission, and error handling
- Write each assertion in a separate `test()` block with meaningful names
- Use only stable selectors like `getByRole` or `getByTestId`
- Focus on functional testing: verify not just visibility, but behavior and outcome of each action
- Organize tests using `test.describe()` for clarity
- Save the test file in the `/tests` directory
